If your manager agrees with your assessment and you receive endorsement from your Business Unit (BU) leadership, your application will be submitted for promotion review in May.</p>

                                <p>All promotion applications are carefully evaluated by the promotion review panel May-June. If you successfully fulfill all requirements, your manager will notify you during your performance discussion in June, and you will officially be promoted in July.</p>

    A promotion can occur within your current Career Path and should be aligned with the goals, competencies, and performance requirements for promotion consideration. However, you can be promoted and move into a new Career Path. If you are looking to make a change in Career Paths and seek advancement, it is important for you to inform your Manager and Career Champion. You will need to demonstrate performance with the competencies at the current Career Level in the different Career Path, as well as demonstrate performance at the next Career Level in order to be reviewed for promotion. This is to make certain you are set up for success to take on the new role and its additional competencies and expectations. We also want to be fair and equitable to other employees who are building the additional competencies in the different Career Paths and consider promotions fairly across the organization.

    The Career Paths are aligned to different career goals. These goals may require you to focus more on one competency or another. For example, the Services Career Path focuses on those employees who want to become a student of the client’s mission. This Career Path focuses on the competencies to progress you into a Subject Matter Expert (SME) role, rather than a Management role. Therefore, competencies like Leads and Develops Others and Maintains and Grows Business would not be included.

                  Our Data &amp; Technology Career Path align to new solutions and capabilities we are developing. Therefore, the focus of these competencies are on Building and Sharing Technical/Functional Expertise and Solving Problems.

    <h3>Career Champions are part coach, part mentor, part communicator, part cultural ambassador, and yes, part leader.</h3>
  
    <p>
      Research shows that 70% of employees feel they do not get enough time to discuss their goals and career aspirations with their leaders.  That is not unique to QinetiQ; that is an industry wide challenge.  <strong>The Career Champion role is critical to truly taking care of our employees and ensuring we are creating and cultivating a people-first culture.</strong> According to Forbes, "Career Champions tend to be more influential in motivating employees to do their best work and feel engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      How exactly will the People care for employees?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Career Champions are career coaches that provide leadership, career guidance, and act as liaisons for HR/ITM programs, resources and benefits.
  </li>
      <li>Career Champions are advocates for their assigned employees, getting to know them + their professional goals and aspirations; help new employees transition from “Day 1” onboarding to engaged QinetiQ teammates.
  </li>
      <li>Career Champions monitor and encourage their people’s development and assess their competencies, providing periodic feedback and writing mid-year and annual reviews (with performance input from managers).
  </li>
      <li>Career Champions motivate, coach, and counsel; they help build trust, resiliency, and professional growth; they have a role in conflict resolution, change management, and more!
  </li>
      <li>Career Champions are culture ambassadors, helping employees understand QinetiQ’s core values and principles, facilitating employee engagement.
  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      In a fast-growing and busy company like QinetiQ, we need to carve out the resources required to make this happen.  In this case, the people resources.  We have amazing managers doing truly impressive things for our clients and our company.  But some of them just don't have the bandwidth to focus on individual careers and the professional growth of every one of their people.  Career Champions will be dedicated to this effort; we ensure that <strong>each Career Champion has a maximum of four people they support. </strong>Listening to those goals and aspirations will be their number one priority.  The research is clear: employees who feel like their voice is being heard are more likely to stay and be more productive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>New employees will be prompted to Opt In or Out of the Career Champion program within 60 days of hire.</strong> Should you Opt-In, your Career Champion should continue coaching you throughout your QinetiQ career journey. As employees move from program to program over time, they will maintain their same Career Champion. This will eventually create a people network across programs and even divisions.  
    </p>
