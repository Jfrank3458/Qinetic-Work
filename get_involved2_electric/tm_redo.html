                        career aspirations with their leaders. That is not unique to QinetiQ; that is an industry wide
                        challenge. The <black-text>Career Champion</black-text> role is critical to truly taking care of
                        our employees and
                        ensuring we are creating and cultivating a people-first culture. According to Forbes,<i>"People
                            leaders tend to be more influential in motivating employees to do their best work and feel
                            engaged."</i></p>

                    <p>In a fast-growing and busy company like QinetiQ, we need to carve out the resources required to
                        make this happen. In this case, the people resources. We have amazing managers doing truly
                        impressive things for our clients and our company. But some of them just don't have the
                        bandwidth to focus on individual careers and the professional growth of every one of their
                        people. Career Champions will be dedicated to this effort; listening to those goals and
                        aspirations will be their number one priority. The research is clear: employees who feel like
                        their voice is being heard are more likely to stay and be more productive.</p>

                    <p>The wonderful world of proposals is at your fingertips! In this three-part course, we will
                        review the foundations of our proposal process, how to review, and how to write proposals.
                        Barbara Eberhard, one of our incredible QinetiQ Alumni, walks us through the information you
                        need to understand how QinetiQ wins new business, how you can get involved with the different
                        stages of a proposal, and how you can reach new levels of expertise in your job through
                        organizational contribution.</p>

                    <p>Make sure you try out your writing skills in the How to Write section. All submitted writings
                        will be reviewed and your name will be added to the list of colleagues to call for future
                        proposal/review teams!</p>
